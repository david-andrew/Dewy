[tasks]
- overhaul the docs
    - look into moving the docs build folder into mdbook folder if possible.
- handling scope while parsing: parsing needs to be chain by chain, namely if a an expression binds a value to an identifier, later expressions should be able to get the type of that identifier!
- rename .type property on AST classes to basetype or default type. Add a type function which does a runtime check of the type
    - really need to make a type matrix for representing results of all the operators on pairs of every combination of types
- post tokanization steps:
    - combining chains of operators into opchains (e.g. x^/-2, needs to chain the ^/- into a single op)
- probably make identifier not a prototype, and instead anything that uses identifiers uses them instead of python strings
    - e.g. Bind(Identifier, AST), Call(Identifier), etc.
- Arrays should create a new scope for their contents
- some sort of process to freeze all lists after chaining so that they can be cached
