//comments are not recognized before the above definition, and would cause the compiler to throw a syntax error

//whitespace is defined first so that the program can recognize whitespace that occurs outside of EBNF rules

    list of predefined tokens:
    - #wildcard: any character (need to be careful with utf-8 representation, and read whole characters rather than just single bytes)
    - #EOF: end of file
    - #whitespace: all possible whitespace characters. This will most likely be predefined b/c ebnf uses (ignores) whitespace. Otherwise would have to define it first as in above
    - #tokenize: tells the compiler to add a new token rule for the specified hashtag
