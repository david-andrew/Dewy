These individual files might probably be turned into folders containing several files because the standard library is going to probably be rather large. e.g. I imagine the standard_library might have sections on math.dewy, networking.dewy (UDP/TCP/etc.), json.dewy, datetime.dewy, etc. 

For now though they will exist as single files.
