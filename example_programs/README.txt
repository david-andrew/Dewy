These are not guaranteed to be 100% compilable by the final dewy compiler. 
Instead they are intended to be the most correct as possible, at the time of their creation. If the language changes later on, it is my intention to change them to match, but not my guarantee

Ideally language_benchmark.dewy is 100% correct, or close to it by a final implementation of Dewy, and is hence designed to test if the compiler is working properly
