<!-- TODO: Move this into the mdbook docs to a reasonable spot -->

## Language Features
* first class physical units (e.g. length, time, mass, temperature, etc.)
* first class functions (as well as many concepts borrowed from functional programming)
    * partial function evalutation
    * unified lambda vs regular function declaration
* simple, easty-to-read, elegant syntax
* optional type system with type inference
* rust-style memory safety gurantees
    * suitable for realtime applications
* powerful meta-programming capabilities 
    * ability to arbitrily add or modify language syntax
    * compiler-compiler uses meta-programming to add all features of the language (meaning compiler implementations are extremely simple/lightweight)
* (planned) extremely fast
* (planned) batteries included, i.e. common data structures, algorithms, libraries, etc. (will be) included
* guranteed syntax stability, backwards compatibility, etc.
    * Once version 1 is released, If it runs on some version, it will run on all future versions
* (planned) simple unified package management system akin to ckan
* (probably) lots of other things...

## Language Examples
An out of date example of the language can be found in [language_benchmark.dewy](resources/language_ideas/example_programs/language_benchmark.dewy)

TODO->write better examples.
