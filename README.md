# Generalized LL Parser
Archived experiments implementing a simple GLL parser in python

## Try it out
These are not really in a runnable state, but interested parties can take a look at [fungll.py](src/fungll.py) which has some examples of running it in the main function. You should be able to just run `python src/fungll.py` to see some output. This should be runnable with python 3.9 or later.

Also look at [cnp.py](src/cnp.py) which was a quick python reimplementation of [C_Clustered_Nonterminal_Parser](github.com/david-andrew/dewy-lang/tree/C_Clustered_Nonterminal_Parser) in python for comparing the resulting Binary Subtree Representation (BSR) output from each method.
