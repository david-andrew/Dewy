# DewySpeak
DewySpeak (Dewy for short) is a programming language that I am developing. The main goal I have for this language is to create a language that is the perfect language that I would want to use. Dewy is a general purpose programming language with a focus on engineering.

Important features of the language
* first class physical units (e.g. length, time, mass, temperature, etc.)
* first class functions (as well as many concepts borrowed from functional programming)
* simple, easty-to-read syntax
* optional type system
* (many other things that I will add later)

To see a good example of the language, see `/DewySpeak/example_programs/language_benchmark.dewy`. At the moment, this source file is a benchmark for the compiler to test that most of the features of the language work properly.

For more information about the current state of the project, see the DewySpeak Trello: https://trello.com/b/YYsedENy/dewyspeak
