#implement early parser from page 6 of Derivation representation using binary subtree sets
#also implement conversion from BSR to SPPF
#test how fast it is compared to FUN-GLL parser
#also compare how complicated the implementation is
#once pick earley or fun-gll, last step is to figure out how to apply disambiguation filters, and any speedups from practical gll parsing
