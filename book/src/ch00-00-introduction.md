# Introduction

Welcome to the Dewy Programming Language Book. This book covers all aspects of the language, including syntax, style, the standard library, examples, etc. 

**Please note that this book and the language are still VERY work in progress. The book is still missing many chapters, and there is currently no complete functioning implementation of the language.** Feel free to check back later, or pester the author about progress**

## What is Dewy

The Dewy Programming Language (also called DewySpeak or simply Dewy) is a simple yet powerful general purpose language designed with engineering applications in mind. I began developing Dewy when I became frustrated at the lack of a single language containing many of the high level engineering features I frequently use, without sacrificing speed and efficiency. Think the functionality and ease of use of matlab or python combined with the speed of a compiled language like C or Rust
