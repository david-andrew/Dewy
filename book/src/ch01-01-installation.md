# Installation

**As mentioned, there is no implementation of the language ready for installation.** When the MVP is complete, the planned installation methods will include prebuilt binaries, along with C source code for building from scratch. Additionally, it is planned to provide some form of online interpreter that people can use to test the language

## Verify Install

When you do have the language properly installed, you should be able to verify that it works like so:

```bash
$ dewy -v
dewy0alpha (version 0.0.1) 
```
