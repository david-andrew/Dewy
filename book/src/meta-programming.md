# Meta Programming

An interesting feature of the language is that it doesn't use a normal compiler. Instead the language is described using the meta language, and this description is used to build the compiler from what is known as a compiler compiler. The meta language makes it incredibly easy to add brand new features to the language, such as new syntax and so forth.

The meta language bears much similarity to [Extended Backus-Naur form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form).

(random stuff to include)
- GLR parser for easier meta programming
- meta language syntax + examples
- etc. TBD
