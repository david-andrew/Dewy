# Units

Dewy was designed from day 1 to include physical units such as kilogram, meter, second. 

## A Simple Example

Using units is quite straightforward, as they can be included in just about any regular math expression

```dewy
mass = 10 kg
velocity = 30 m/s
energy = 1/2 * mass * velocity^2
```

The `energy` variable now contains a value of `9000 joules`.
