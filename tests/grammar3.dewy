//example grammar for numeric expressions 
//based on https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/47904

//addition/subtraction (left associative)
#S = #S '+' #A | #S '-' #A | #A;

//multiplication/division (left associative)
#A = #A '*' #E | #A '/' #E | #E;

//exponentiation (right associative)
#E = #T '^' #E | #T;

//terms (numbers/identifiers/groups)
//technically these are ambiguous without a longest match filter, but this particular grammer works out,
//since the rnglr algorithms can do actions in parallel, only the longest match will remain at the end.
#T = #N | #I | #G;
#N = [0-9]+;
#I = [A-Za-z_] [A-Za-z0-9!@%&_?]*;
#G = '(' #S ')';
