//(fixed) This bug is that sub parses for filters would fail for any generalized parse where the start of the sub rule was not a terminal string
//caused by not generating special follow sets for rules in filters, since they don't appear in the grammar, and thus don't actually have any follow terminals

#S = [Aa] | #id;

// id should not be able to derive 'A' as it should be reject filtered
#id = [A-Z] - #B;

// if B = 'A' directly, the filter works fine
#B = #A;
#A = 'A';
